              Bitumen is a black, sticky, and highly viscous material that is a
              naturally occurring substance. It is primarily composed of
              hydrocarbons and is found in petroleum deposits.It is a key
              component in the development of infrastructure projects,
              particularly in the construction of roads and highways. Bitumen is
              a dense, viscous material derived from petroleum that is used to
              bind and protect the aggregate (such as gravel or crushed stone)
              in asphalt pavements.
            </p>
            <p>
              Infrastructure project development firms use bitumen for its
              durability, flexibility, and ability to withstand harsh weather
              conditions, making it ideal for use in long-term construction
              projects. Bitumen is also commonly used to waterproof structures,
              such as bridges and culverts, to prevent water from penetrating
              the surface and causing damage over time.
            </p>
            <p>
              The use of bitumen in infrastructure projects is a critical factor
              in ensuring that the infrastructure is safe, efficient, and
              long-lasting. In addition, infrastructure project development
              firms typically invest in high-quality bitumen products to ensure
              consistent and reliable performance, as well as to minimize the
              likelihood of premature failure.

                <h4>VG 30 Bitumen.</h4>
              </div>
              <p>
                VG-30 is generally utilised in the construction of exceptionally
                industrial grade Bitumen Pavements that must withstand heavy
                traffic loads. It can be substituted with Penetration Grade
                60/70.
              </p>
              <p>
                In India, VG 30 bitumen is a common bitumen grade. This type of
                bitumen is preferred by Indian importers since its performance
                in Indian road building has been proven. In India, VG 30 grade
                bitumen is also utilized for plastic roadways.
              </p>
              <p>
                We deploy VG30 in high-temperature settings because of its
                strong thermal sensitivity. Instead of bitumen penetration
                grades, VG-30 bitumen is also suited for usage in hot and wet
                weather. The higher the viscosity of the bitumen, the less
                probable it is to be affected by water.

                VG-40 is used in highly stressed areas such as intersections,
                near toll booths and truck parking lots in lieu of old 30/40
                Penetration Grade. Due to its higher Viscosity, stiffer Bitumen
                Mixes can be produced to improve resistance to shoving and other
                problems associated with higher temperature and heavy traffic
                loads.
              </p>
              <p>
                VG-40 bitumen is used in areas in which high pressure comes from
                heavy traffic loads, such as intersections, near tolls booths,
                and truck parking lots.Due to the high viscosity of this
                bitumen, it is more appropriate for improving resistance to
                shoving and other problems associated with higher temperatures
                and heavy traffic loads.

                It's long time that industries use vg-40 instead of the
                penetration grade bitumen 40/50.The difference between VG30 and
                Vg40The difference between VG-30 and VG-40 is that the VG 30
                bitumen is suitable for mild weather and VG 40 bitumen is better
                to use in hot climate. If you need to consult before buying vg40
